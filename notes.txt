    DOM stands for Document Object Model

    Just understand that almost every single interaction on your page , for example like slideshow on a carousel , navigation menu items all are result of the javascript accessing and manupuleting the dom.


    1. Is the dom a programming language ?

    No. DOM is not a programming language. However, without DOM the client side javascript would be prettey useless as it would not have any model for accessing HTML document.

    2. Where does the DOM comes form?

    The dom doesnot comes from javascript.
    The Browser gives us the access to the Dom. This means that different browsers will have their own unique way of creating the DOM .

    . EVERYTHING IN THE BROWSER CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A OBJECT.

    When we start accessing this document Object . we have a whole lots of properties and methods available to us straight out of the box and we could access these properties and methods.


    window.document
    console.log()
    console.dir(document)
    document.forms

    BOM stand for Browser Object Model

    The console object gives you to asccess to the browser console. 
    this console allowes the developers to log certain results and alerts and warning to the screen.
    

    How did we have that methods available to us. we, You need to understand the window object. the console is a part of the window object.

    3. What is window object?
    Window object is supplied by what is known as the browser Object Model of you can say for short as BOM.


BOM allowes javascript to talk to the browser about things other than the content of the webpage.

Javascript can also interect directectly with what the users looking at on the webpage.

there is also other information that the browsers window gives us.


4. What other information ? Well things like navigator , screen location , history etc.

The window object is the root element of the whole website.

Window provides two broad categories of functionality to us.

It provides us with the document. Document means it"s the website like titles on the screen, buttons we can click on it.
the other thing it gives us though, are things like i mentioned, the navigation , location , screen , history etc.


Now we know that window object is. and each browser tab has its own window object.

When you got two different tabs open in your browser,they can't share each other objects.

The one has a window object and the other has an ectirely different window object.

the other thing worth mentioning is that there is no standerds for the browser object model.

We know like for javascript we have got the standerd ECMASCRIPT . well there are no standers for the bom and the html document.


. You can access the window object properties using dots.
. so window.console is how we can access the console object.

If you remember we did not typed window.
We just typed console. for window object there is no need to type window.
