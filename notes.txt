    DOM stands for Document Object Model

    Just understand that almost every single interaction on your page , for example like slideshow on a carousel , navigation menu items all are result of the javascript accessing and manupuleting the dom.


    1. Is the dom a programming language ?

    No. DOM is not a programming language. However, without DOM the client side javascript would be prettey useless as it would not have any model for accessing HTML document.

    2. Where does the DOM comes form?

    The dom doesnot comes from javascript.
    The Browser gives us the access to the Dom. This means that different browsers will have their own unique way of creating the DOM .

    . EVERYTHING IN THE BROWSER CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A OBJECT.

    When we start accessing this document Object . we have a whole lots of properties and methods available to us straight out of the box and we could access these properties and methods.


    window.document
    console.log()
    console.dir(document)
    document.forms

    BOM stand for Browser Object Model

    The console object gives you to asccess to the browser console. 
    this console allowes the developers to log certain results and alerts and warning to the screen.
    

    How did we have that methods available to us. we, You need to understand the window object. the console is a part of the window object.

    3. What is window object?
    Window object is supplied by what is known as the browser Object Model of you can say for short as BOM.


BOM allowes javascript to talk to the browser about things other than the content of the webpage.

Javascript can also interect directectly with what the users looking at on the webpage.

there is also other information that the browsers window gives us.


4. What other information ? Well things like navigator , screen location , history etc.

The window object is the root element of the whole website.

Window provides two broad categories of functionality to us.

It provides us with the document. Document means it"s the website like titles on the screen, buttons we can click on it.
the other thing it gives us though, are things like i mentioned, the navigation , location , screen , history etc.


Now we know that window object is. and each browser tab has its own window object.

When you got two different tabs open in your browser,they can't share each other objects.

The one has a window object and the other has an ectirely different window object.

the other thing worth mentioning is that there is no standerds for the browser object model.

We know like for javascript we have got the standerd ECMASCRIPT . well there are no standers for the bom and the html document.


. You can access the window object properties using dots.
. so window.console is how we can access the console object.

If you remember we did not typed window.
We just typed console. for window object there is no need to type window.

Q. dom vs javascript ?
q. what is the difference between Dom and the Javascript?
DOM looks at our document object within our hierarchical structure.
thats what DOM is ..

At the very basic lavel , we now that every website consists of an HTML document and this document in a model.  And we just so happen to call that model the DOM- Document Object Model

This model allows javascript and other programming languages for that matter, to access elements of the website as Objects


We can also manipulate it when the user clicks on the button, changing colors like that we can do by accessing and manipulating the DOM .

But without it, Javascript and other programming languages do not have any model for accessing the webpage.

Now you can understand that DOM and Javascript are completly different entities . 

The page content is stored in the DOM And javascript is one of the different languages that is given access to all of this content.

As a side note DOM is designed to be independent of any programming langiuage

However we mostly use the javascript to access the DOM to manipulate the HTML, But you can also use python with the xml.

When we use the DOM with the XML , DOM just structures that contain as tree of branches as nodes. Where each node in the tree is an Object.

The more importent application of the DOM is learning how to use it with XML 

Q. is dom same as html ?

The DOM is not your HTML . There are two reasons why your HTML can differ from the DOM .

First reason is that if you have errors in your HTML itself
Second reason is when the dom is modified by javascript.
lets look at these in more details . 

When you have got errors in html . well remember that the DOM is the interface for valid HTML documents .

During the process of creating the DOM the browser is going to correct some invalidation in your HTML.

We know this is not a valid HTML. there is no head tag and body tag . If we look at the dom in our browser.

Dom GONNA CREATE A HEAD TAG AND A BODY TAG AND WITHIN THE BODY TAG IT CREATED THE TEXT NODE.

The another reason is when javascript modifies the DOM .

DOM is also not what you see in the browser.

You should know about the render tree. Render tree is nothing but the combination of the DOM and the CSSOM.

So, it makes sense that the render tree will exclude certain elements that are not meant to be displayed.

We have paragraph element set to display none.
So what will happen from DOM point of view is that the DOM will eventually have this paragraph.But the render tree will excluded it from being painted on the screen. 
DOM is alse not the same what is present in the dev tools.

The difference is a bit more miniscule because the dev tools element inspector provides the closest approximation to the DOM that we have in the browser.
But sometimes the devtools inspector includes additional information that is not a DOM.

the best example is psudo elements.

***************** ---------------****************

Q. What is DOM api?
Now we are comfortable that what DOM actually is.
But the common confusion normally we have is the difference between the DOM and the javascript.
In other words we are trying to understand that is the DOM same as the javascript. The short ans is no.

The browser creates the DOM to render the page. And the Browser gives javascript access to the DOM which is a programming language.
